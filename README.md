This is a css theme for firefox, aiming to make the UI a little more simplistic while retaining all important features. This draws a lot of inspiration from [minimal functional fox](https://github.com/mut-ex/minimal-functional-fox) which is definitely worth checking out.
 
This is a work in progress and by no means done :)
